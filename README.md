menu-bar-search
---------------

This is based on the workflow by Jeroen van der Neut. It was his excellent idea and he provided the original Applescript to extract menu items.

This workflow lets you control the front-most application by triggering menu actions. The text entered is used to display matching menu items. Some apps have such large menus that performance is terrible, e.g., Safari.

network-info
------------

This is based on David Ferguson's IP Address workflow. The difference is that it provides interface names and mac address.

The workflow responds to the keywords 'ip' and 'mac'. For the 'ip' keyword it lists all interfaces and the local IP addresses. It also displays the external IP address. For the 'mac' keyword it lists all interfaces and the local MAC addresses.

If you select an IP address or MAC address it will be copied to the clipboard. Holding down the cmd modifier key will also paste it in the front-most application.

Based on the workflows by Clinton Strong and David Ferguson. The difference is it consolidates the OS/X recent documents list and the Alfred recent documentst list.
